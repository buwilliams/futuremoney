## The Results

The 16-day experiment, Future Money, is complete. The idea was simple, live on a daily allowance. Each day I’d transfer my daily allowance into a debit checking account I call my Cash Account. I was only allowed to spend money out of this account. Expenses such as eating out, groceries, gasoline, clothes, and fun were paid out of my Cash Account. If I didn’t have the money in the Cash Account I wasn’t allowed to buy it. If I asked the question, can I buy X then I merely needed to look in my Cash Account to know. [You can read about the experiment here.](/post/16-day-personal-finances-experiment/)

## I can see clearly now that the rain is gone.

Living this way opened my eyes to what it means to be responsible with money. For the first time I felt the value of a single dollar. Phrases like, __“A penny saved is a penny earned.”__ were always replaying in my mind.

I’m happy to report that I was able to stick to the plan. Each day, I spent only what I had in my Cash Account. For the first week it was fun being resourceful. After the first week, I felt depressed. I felt that I was so broke all the time. The more I restricted myself the more I found reasons to spend money. By the end of the 16 days I was so happy to be done with the experiment. I’d learned too much and overall it is a __brilliant success!__

## Changing my daily allowance.

I decided to increase my Daily Allowance by $10. It’s been another 16 days since then and I’m completely happy. I have plenty of money each day so I’m able to keep a rolling balance. During the week it grows since I spend less during the work week. I have no trouble affording gasoline, groceries, and fun activities. I do all this with complete assurance that I’m making wise financial decisions.

People ask me what I’ll do once the DA account gets large. Will I put the extra money in savings? Will I ever start the Cash Account at zero again? My answer is the same, why would I do any of those things? I’m happy to let the account grow as big as it wants. That growth represents my process at handling money. It represents my ability to buy what I want when I want because I’ve earned it a day at a time. I cannot overstate how great having a balance in my Cash Account makes me feel. __I feel like a financial champion.__

## In debt but not broke.

I used to believe that because I had debts that until I paid them off I would be a failure. I now see that this was just a bad story I told myself. Debt can be repaid. Sure the financial institutions will earn their interest but what do I care? If I’m growing then I’m growing. I know that sounds mathematically irresponsible but I don’t think it is. The better I do as a person, the better I can do at work, the less stress I feel the more able I am. It’s all downhill from here and that’s the key. Once the machine is working, it’s all growth and that’s a great way to live. __You don’t have to be broke when you’re in debit.__

## My buffers are growing.

I have money in all my accounts. The buffers in each of them are all growing each time I’m paid. My business account balance is growing. My savings account balance is growing. My Main Checking account balance is growing and within a year I’ll have enough to no longer live paycheck to paycheck. I’m paying down debt responsibility. I’ve decided that growing my buffers is more important than aggressively paying down debt. This was a very important decision to make since if I’m able to handle the ups and downs of life my finances will not be ruined by an expected flat tire.

**It’s financial security and it feels great.**

## Vocabulary Words

- **Future Money** - money meant to be used over time. You don’t have $500, you have $16 dollars over 31 days. This is the key principal to the whole plan.
- **Present Money** - money which you are allowed to spend now.
- **DA or Daily Allowance** - the amount of money you deposit into your Cash Account each day. You take a planned monthly amount, say $500, and divide it by 31 days to get your DA.
- **Cash Account** - a debit card checking account which houses a rolling balance your present money. You buy gasoline, groceries, and fun out of this account.
- **Main Account** - the account which gets your direct deposits, the checking account you pay bills from, the money you pay down debt and save money.
- **Buffer** - any additional balance of money you keep in any account. This money acts a protection against being completely broke.


## 16 day journal

I’ve kept a journal of my experience. You can read it below it all it’s glorious detail.
I made a point to write down how each day went. I knew that research shows
that if you write things down you're more likely to remember and stick with
it.

### Day 1 of 16: Thursday
- I had everything I needed for a salad over lunch except bell pepper and turkey. I was low on cashews as well. Instead of buying turkey realized that I had some remaining deli ham. I found another bag of older nuts to help with the missing cashews. I decided to go without bell pepper.
- I was low of gasoline for my car but instead of buying it decided I could stretch it until tomorrow.
- For dinner at my girlfriend's we needed chicken and green beans. She's out of butter so instead of buying it, I brought over a stick from my fridge. We ate a low cost meal. Cost was $14.64.
- So far, these restrictions have felt more fun, creative, and inspiring rather than difficult. Turns out resourcefulness is enjoyable.
- Ended the day with $5.30 balance (it was 15.30 but a purchase with a tip was pending)

### Day 2 of 16: Friday
- Needed gas. Went to QT. Bought $15 worth of gasoline. I was nervous to see how much that would give me. I was pleased to find that I got a half tank out of it. Plenty for the weekend.
- Discovered an auto-draft bill for HBO coming out of my spending account that should be coming out of my billing account. Need correct or cancel. Transferring money to compensate amount.
- Pending transactions are a pain. If you tip and the transaction is processing then the balance of your account is inaccurate because tip isn't included.
- Needed to buy groceries for lunch do I did and picked up breakfast stuff to do that me and the kids have breakfast and lunch covered this weekend. Cost: $35.68
- I've started to realize that the key is to build up enough money in my cash account that I wouldn't likely spend it on a single day, say $1,000 dollars
- Sadly I bought chocolate milk because I assumed the one I had was expired but it wasn't.
- Maybe the key principal is to never spend future money!
- The biggest challenge was dinner with my kids. I pick them up at 7pm. Sometimes they've eaten and sometimes not. We ate Ramen.
- Ended the day with $9.56

### Day 3 of 16: Saturday

- I already have breakfast and lunch for today and tomorrow. The only thing that is a challenge is dinner for tonight.
- Turns out the kids were okay to eat the salad I made which was a relief
- Decided to make beef stew for dinner. Wasn't sure I had enough money but I just barely did. Cost: $28.18
- Emma's birthday was July 3rd. I promised her Rollerblades. It's been over a month. She has been patient. Yesterday, I took money from savings to buy them. Price $139. While, I prefer to maximize my savings, I felt this exception was reasonable.
- Family came over unexpectedly which was not what I wanted. Hard to host when you're broke. They actually helped a bunch instead of making it worse.
- Made the beef stew (it took 3 hours!!!)
- Ended the day with $11.38

### Day 4 of 16: Sunday

- While transferring my daily allowance, my account balance was at $1.37 because another subscription I forgot about went through at $9.99. I was not happy. I pulled this money from my billing account since it's a bill.
- I'm thinking about my vaping habit. It's $20 every 5 days. That's $4 of my daily allowance! Eek. I should quit for better health too. It makes me congested and anxious.
- I shared the plan with my friend Chris and my Mom. Both are trying the plan or have said they will. I'd feel so grateful if they benefited. I think Casey and my work friend Chris may also try this.
- Starting the day with $41.38.
- Casey and I made Creamy White Chicken Chili. My portion cost $32. It'll last me 3 dinners! Dinner tends to be the most expensive for eating out. Plus, I had the money in my cash account.
- Ended the day with $8.96

### Day 5 of 16: Monday

- iTunes charged me $5.99. Another subscription I completely forgot about. It good to find all these. Honestly, I have no idea what it's for. Time to find out! Turned out to be Soundcloud subscription.
- Starting the day with $38.96
- I have plenty of gas for my car today. I have breakfast at home. I need lettuce for salad and coffee but I think that's it. Romaine and coffee cost $8.06. I need creamer but I can buy that tomorrow.
- Every dollar matters now. The same impact was had on Chris.

### Day 6 of 16: Tuesday

- After DA starting balance is $59.91. This is the most money I've had in the account so far.
- Mom texted me and said she and her husband Chris are doing the plan together. If I can help her it's a major fucking win.
- I need to buy creamer for coffee today so that I'm not out tomorrow morning. Other than that I do not need groceries.
- Acroyoga is hosted a dinner for Will tonight which I needed to attend. I will need to at least but a drink. Perhaps food. I'll be careful because I do not want to lose ground I've gained.
- It's clear to me that this plan works. It's tough to realize that you have less than you'd like to admit. But there is power and freedom in knowing.
- We to grocery store to buy coffee creamer. It costs $3.66. Not bad for being the only thing I've spent money on so far!
- Tonight was especially tempting. It was Will's final party before brain surgery. It's all very emotional which has nothing to do with money. But there was good food at the restaurant and I was hungry since I hadn't eaten but had been Acro'ing. I decided to get a drink only which I had cash for in my wallet. So I didn't spend any money from my DA. I hope Will's surgery and recovery are smooth and he is able to beat this cancer. Who fucking cares about saved money though I am proud of my restraint.
- Ended the day with $56.25. It's my record so far. I'm doing very well.
- As I do this I'll learn when splurging is okay and good. I don't want to live in a prison of worry or regret.

### Day 7 of 16: Wednesday

- Starting balance of $86.26. It seems easy to spend less than that I have today. I've been restricting myself for 7 days. I know what I need and how to do it. How will I feel with $200, or $500, or $1,000? Exciting times ahead!
- I made my first purchase, LED candle light bulbs from Amazon. They were $25.51. I need them because my current bulbs heat my office making it uncomfortable. They use too much energy and cost me AC. I have the money so it's okay.
- I've been tempted to pull money from my main account to pay for the lightbulbs. I try and justify that it's a budgetable expense but I didn't budge for it. It's exactly this type of thing that I need to resist!
- Went to acroyoga cost tonight. Paid $10. Light Bulbs and acroyoga were my only expenses. I saved $5 today!
- Ended up $50.75

### Day 8 of 16: Thursday, halfway!

- Starting DA with $80.74
- Things I need: coffee, eggs, bell pepper, lettuce, turkey, gas, and dinner. Could be a big spending day off I'm not careful.

### Day 12 of 16: Monday

- Starting DA $43.51
- This is the last week of my 16 day experiment. It's exciting to realize that I've me are it! I haven't spent one dollar of future money. Soon I'll be paying down debt, saving money, building buffers in my main account, business account, and a small buffer in my cash account.
- Idea: each time I get extra money, I can deposit a little extra in my cash account so that my buffer grows. I could even do that as a reward for hitting my pay cycle budget.
- I could offer an online future money course. It would be free. I could stand up my own domain. It would be a simple website with my story, my budget, and videos for how to do it. I could also teach a seminar at a local Meetup.
- Groceries: creamer, lettuce, cashews, Bell pepper, balsamic at $20.00
- Made one pot meal with Casey. Spent $34.96 on groceries (Casey bought) but didn't have enough to pay so I'll transfer the amount tomorrow morning.

### Day 13 of 16: Tuesday

- Starting DA $53.21
- Venmo'ed $35 to Casey for groceries last night, now have $18.21 for you the rest of the day.
- Went to a bar after acroyoga to see my friends. World's most expensive Sprite at $5.27
Day 14 of 16: Wednesday
- Starting DA at $42.94
- Got my car emissions and tag renewal done today. This was in the budget so it didn't come out of DA.
- The past two days have been the toughest. Physically and emotional stress have made following my DA much harder to follow.
- Groceries at Trader Joe's. $15.14
- Gas at Shell station $25.73
- Ending balance at $3.07

### Day 14 of 16: Wednesday

- Starting DA $33.07
- I've created futuremoney.info as an easy way point someone to the plan in hopes it helps someone.
- I've learned that it makes sense to have "bonus" DAs. For example, when I have my kids or for a date night with Casey. An easy way to achieve this is doubling the DA for those days. To calculate this just add days to 31. Kids is 4 days and date night once a week is 4. That's 8 extra days. How can I track them? I could give myself them at the beginning so that I don't think about it.
- Discussed the bonus day with Chris. He thinks it goes against the principles of FM. He's right. I'll need to up my DA next week.
- In the beginning I was real excited and tried to spend nothing, I realized it wasn't practical so my carry over isn't much if any. So, I'll up my DA next pay period but I think it's important to start low and adjust after a pay period.
- Ending the day with $5.98

### Day 15 of 16: Thursday

- Forgot to journal today.

### Day 16 of 16: Friday
- Starting DA $32.00
- Was paid. Paid my bills. Updated my DA for next cycle for $40 a day.
- Going to buy myself CFA for dinner. That's all the money I will spend today.
