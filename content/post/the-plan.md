## The Problem
### 3 out 4 Americans live paycheck to paycheck.

I've always spent what I've made. As my career grew so did my spending. Always living paycheck to paycheck. As my income grew so did my debts. I tried many ways to stop spending but nothing truly worked for me. What about you, can you relate?

I blame the fact that delayed gratification is hard. Also, I was the kid jealous of other student's packed lunches and new clothes. When I started making money I could have the things and experiences I couldn't before. This led to bad habits leaving me with no money.

It's a vicious cycle. You overspend, you pull money from savings, or use a credit card, or don't pay a bill. This just puts you further behind. It quickly becomes a mess, leaving you with piles of debt and loads of discouragement.

## The Solution
### Live on a daily allowance.

I give myself a Daily Allowance or DA for short. Each day I deposit my DA into a separate account called my Cash Account. I try to spend less than my DA every day. I carry whatever I do not spend to the next day. This allows me to build a Buffer into my Cash Account.

**Common Daily Allowances**

| Day | Month  |
| :-- | :----- |
| $10 | $310   |
| $20 | $620   |
| $30 | $930   |
| $40 | $1,240 |
| $50 | $1,550 |
| $60 | $1,850 |

## The Principals
### Why Future Money works so well.

1. We're not good with moneyâ€“mainly Money Over Time. $500 isn't $500, it's $16 a day. This is why we overspend, we think there is more than there is.
2. Never spend future money. Give yourself a DA every day and live off Present Money.
3. You can live without almost anything for a day or two. Think about it: gasoline, food, and fun can all wait.
4. Try to spend less than your DA each day. Make it a game. Being resourceful is fun once you get into it!

## The Rules
### A 16 day step-by-step action plan.

1. You get paid. Money goes into your Main Account.
2. Pay bills, payoff debt, saving money, and keep future DA in your Main Account.
3. Day 1: Start with $0 in your Cash Account.
4. Deposit your Daily Allowance into your Cash Account and check your balance. This is what you have today for gasoline, groceries, and day to day expenses.
5. Try to spend less than your DA each day.
6. Keep a daily journal of your progress, successes, and failures. Tell your friends.
7. Repeat each day for 16 days. If after 16 days you believe it works for you, keep going.

| #2  | $35              | $15   | $20            |

| #4  | $45              | $5    | $40            |
| #5  | $70              | $20   | $50            |
| #6  | $80              | $20   | $60            |
| #7  | $90              | $20   | $70            |
