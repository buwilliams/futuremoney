<h2 id="the-results">The Results</h2>

<p>You know what&rsquo;s coming: <em>The experiment was a brilliant success.</em> I&rsquo;ve been
able to manage my money better than ever. Not only did I hit my budget targets,
I beat them. Future money allowed me to get control of my spending and with
that kind of control the rest of my budget went according to plan more or less.</p>

<h2 id="16-day-journal">16 day journal</h2>

<p>I made a point to write down how each day went. I knew that research shows
that if you write things down you&rsquo;re more likely to remember and stick with
it.</p>

<h3 id="day-1-of-16-thursday">Day 1 of 16: Thursday</h3>

<ul>
<li>I had everything I needed for a salad over lunch except bell pepper and turkey. I was low on cashews as well. Instead of buying turkey realized that I had some remaining deli ham. I found another bag of older nuts to help with the missing cashews. I decided to go without bell pepper.</li>
<li>I was low of gasoline for my car but instead of buying it decided I could stretch it until tomorrow.</li>
<li>For dinner at my girlfriend&rsquo;s we needed chicken and green beans. She&rsquo;s out of butter so instead of buying it, I brought over a stick from my fridge. We ate a low cost meal. Cost was $14.64.</li>
<li>So far, these restrictions have felt more fun, creative, and inspiring rather than difficult. Turns out resourcefulness is enjoyable.</li>
<li>Ended the day with $5.30 balance (it was 15.30 but a purchase with a tip was pending)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-2-of-16-friday">Day 2 of 16: Friday</h3>

<ul>
<li>Needed gas. Went to QT. Bought $15 worth of gasoline. I was nervous to see how much that would give me. I was pleased to find that I got a half tank out of it. Plenty for the weekend.</li>
<li>Discovered an auto-draft bill for HBO coming out of my spending account that should be coming out of my billing account. Need correct or cancel. Transferring money to compensate amount.</li>
<li>Pending transactions are a pain. If you tip and the transaction is processing then the balance of your account is inaccurate because tip isn&rsquo;t included.</li>
<li>Needed to buy groceries for lunch do I did and picked up breakfast stuff to do that me and the kids have breakfast and lunch covered this weekend. Cost: $35.68</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve started to realize that the key is to build up enough money in my cash account that I wouldn&rsquo;t likely spend it on a single day, say $1,000 dollars</li>
<li>Sadly I bought chocolate milk because I assumed the one I had was expired but it wasn&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>Maybe the key principal is to never spend future money!</li>
<li>The biggest challenge was dinner with my kids. I pick them up at 7pm. Sometimes they&rsquo;ve eaten and sometimes not. We ate Ramen.</li>
<li>Ended the day with $9.56</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-3-of-16-saturday">Day 3 of 16: Saturday</h3>

<ul>
<li>I already have breakfast and lunch for today and tomorrow. The only thing that is a challenge is dinner for tonight.</li>
<li>Turns out the kids were okay to eat the salad I made which was a relief</li>
<li>Decided to make beef stew for dinner. Wasn&rsquo;t sure I had enough money but I just barely did. Cost: $28.18</li>
<li>Emma&rsquo;s birthday was July 3rd. I promised her Rollerblades. It&rsquo;s been over a month. She has been patient. Yesterday, I took money from savings to buy them. Price $139. While, I prefer to maximize my savings, I felt this exception was reasonable.</li>
<li>Family came over unexpectedly which was not what I wanted. Hard to host when you&rsquo;re broke. They actually helped a bunch instead of making it worse.</li>
<li>Made the beef stew (it took 3 hours!!!)</li>
<li>Ended the day with $11.38</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-4-of-16-sunday">Day 4 of 16: Sunday</h3>

<ul>
<li>While transferring my daily allowance, my account balance was at $1.37 because another subscription I forgot about went through at $9.99. I was not happy. I pulled this money from my billing account since it&rsquo;s a bill.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m thinking about my vaping habit. It&rsquo;s $20 every 5 days. That&rsquo;s $4 of my daily allowance! Eek. I should quit for better health too. It makes me congested and anxious.</li>
<li>I shared the plan with my friend Chris and my Mom. Both are trying the plan or have said they will. I&rsquo;d feel so grateful if they benefited. I think Casey and my work friend Chris may also try this.</li>
<li>Starting the day with $41.38.</li>
<li>Casey and I made Creamy White Chicken Chili. My portion cost $32. It&rsquo;ll last me 3 dinners! Dinner tends to be the most expensive for eating out. Plus, I had the money in my cash account.</li>
<li>Ended the day with $8.96</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-5-of-16-monday">Day 5 of 16: Monday</h3>

<ul>
<li>iTunes charged me $5.99. Another subscription I completely forgot about. It good to find all these. Honestly, I have no idea what it&rsquo;s for. Time to find out! Turned out to be Soundcloud subscription.</li>
<li>Starting the day with $38.96</li>
<li>I have plenty of gas for my car today. I have breakfast at home. I need lettuce for salad and coffee but I think that&rsquo;s it. Romaine and coffee cost $8.06. I need creamer but I can buy that tomorrow.</li>
<li>Every dollar matters now. The same impact was had on Chris.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-6-of-16-tuesday">Day 6 of 16: Tuesday</h3>

<ul>
<li>After DA starting balance is $59.91. This is the most money I&rsquo;ve had in the account so far.</li>
<li>Mom texted me and said she and her husband Chris are doing the plan together. If I can help her it&rsquo;s a major fucking win.</li>
<li>I need to buy creamer for coffee today so that I&rsquo;m not out tomorrow morning. Other than that I do not need groceries.</li>
<li>Acroyoga is hosted a dinner for Will tonight which I needed to attend. I will need to at least but a drink. Perhaps food. I&rsquo;ll be careful because I do not want to lose ground I&rsquo;ve gained.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s clear to me that this plan works. It&rsquo;s tough to realize that you have less than you&rsquo;d like to admit. But there is power and freedom in knowing.</li>
<li>We to grocery store to buy coffee creamer. It costs $3.66. Not bad for being the only thing I&rsquo;ve spent money on so far!</li>
<li>Tonight was especially tempting. It was Will&rsquo;s final party before brain surgery. It&rsquo;s all very emotional which has nothing to do with money. But there was good food at the restaurant and I was hungry since I hadn&rsquo;t eaten but had been Acro&rsquo;ing. I decided to get a drink only which I had cash for in my wallet. So I didn&rsquo;t spend any money from my DA. I hope Will&rsquo;s surgery and recovery are smooth and he is able to beat this cancer. Who fucking cares about saved money though I am proud of my restraint.</li>
<li>Ended the day with $56.25. It&rsquo;s my record so far. I&rsquo;m doing very well.</li>
<li>As I do this I&rsquo;ll learn when splurging is okay and good. I don&rsquo;t want to live in a prison of worry or regret.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-7-of-16-wednesday">Day 7 of 16: Wednesday</h3>

<ul>
<li>Starting balance of $86.26. It seems easy to spend less than that I have today. I&rsquo;ve been restricting myself for 7 days. I know what I need and how to do it. How will I feel with $200, or $500, or $1,000? Exciting times ahead!</li>
<li>I made my first purchase, LED candle light bulbs from Amazon. They were $25.51. I need them because my current bulbs heat my office making it uncomfortable. They use too much energy and cost me AC. I have the money so it&rsquo;s okay.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been tempted to pull money from my main account to pay for the lightbulbs. I try and justify that it&rsquo;s a budgetable expense but I didn&rsquo;t budge for it. It&rsquo;s exactly this type of thing that I need to resist!</li>
<li>Went to acroyoga cost tonight. Paid $10. Light Bulbs and acroyoga were my only expenses. I saved $5 today!</li>
<li>Ended up $50.75</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-8-of-16-thursday-halfway">Day 8 of 16: Thursday, halfway!</h3>

<ul>
<li>Starting DA with $80.74</li>
<li>Things I need: coffee, eggs, bell pepper, lettuce, turkey, gas, and dinner. Could be a big spending day off I&rsquo;m not careful.</li>
<li>Groceries cost $18.72. Didn&rsquo;t buy dinner since I have beef stew at Casey&rsquo;s.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-9-of-16-friday">Day 9 of 16: Friday</h3>

<ul>
<li>Starting DA with $93.02, highest starting DA to date!</li>
<li>Paid Casey for movies we watched last night, $13.00</li>
<li>Chris texted, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t spent any money on my credit card last week&rdquo;</li>
<li>Wrote an blog post about being half way.</li>
<li>Bought sliced deli ham for omelette and breath mints for fun at $5.96</li>
<li>Casey and I decided to have a date night dinner at home: filet mignon, broccoli, mashed potatoes, wine, and dessert. Total cost for me was $25.69</li>
<li>We rented a movie for $3.99</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t been eating much added sugar recently so it immediately knocked me out as insulin flooded my body.</li>
<li>Ended the night with $56.13</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-10-of-16-saturday">Day 10 of 16: Saturday</h3>

<ul>
<li>Forgot to journal today.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-11-of-16-sunday">Day 11 of 16: Sunday</h3>

<ul>
<li>Starting DA with $86.13</li>
<li>Bought correct bulbs for $18.58</li>
<li>Got half tank at $15.05</li>
<li>Bought vitamin water $1.98</li>
<li>Casey and I bought dinner, snacks, and drinks for $69.77. Casey&rsquo;s portion was $36.00. My portion was $33.77.</li>
<li>My balance is now $9.51, gasp!
Day 11 of 16: Sunday</li>
<li>Staying DA $39.51</li>
<li>Breakfast at Waffle House, $13</li>
<li>Dinner at Casey&rsquo;s parents (free!)</li>
<li>Ending balance $27.51</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-12-of-16-monday">Day 12 of 16: Monday</h3>

<ul>
<li>Starting DA $43.51</li>
<li>This is the last week of my 16 day experiment. It&rsquo;s exciting to realize that I&rsquo;ve me are it! I haven&rsquo;t spent one dollar of future money. Soon I&rsquo;ll be paying down debt, saving money, building buffers in my main account, business account, and a small buffer in my cash account.</li>
<li>Idea: each time I get extra money, I can deposit a little extra in my cash account so that my buffer grows. I could even do that as a reward for hitting my pay cycle budget.</li>
<li>I could offer an online future money course. It would be free. I could stand up my own domain. It would be a simple website with my story, my budget, and videos for how to do it. I could also teach a seminar at a local Meetup.</li>
<li>Groceries: creamer, lettuce, cashews, Bell pepper, balsamic at $20.00</li>
<li>Made one pot meal with Casey. Spent $34.96 on groceries (Casey bought) but didn&rsquo;t have enough to pay so I&rsquo;ll transfer the amount tomorrow morning.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-13-of-16-tuesday">Day 13 of 16: Tuesday</h3>

<ul>
<li>Starting DA $53.21</li>
<li>Venmo&rsquo;ed $35 to Casey for groceries last night, now have $18.21 for you the rest of the day.</li>
<li>Went to a bar after acroyoga to see my friends. World&rsquo;s most expensive Sprite at $5.27
Day 14 of 16: Wednesday</li>
<li>Starting DA at $42.94</li>
<li>Got my car emissions and tag renewal done today. This was in the budget so it didn&rsquo;t come out of DA.</li>
<li>The past two days have been the toughest. Physically and emotional stress have made following my DA much harder to follow.</li>
<li>Groceries at Trader Joe&rsquo;s. $15.14</li>
<li>Gas at Shell station $25.73</li>
<li>Ending balance at $3.07</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="day-14-of-16-wednesday">Day 14 of 16: Wednesday</h3>

<ul>
<li>Starting DA $33.07</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve created futuremoney.info as an easy way point someone to the plan in hopes it helps someone.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve learned that it makes sense to have &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; DAs. For example, when I have my kids or for a date night with Casey. An easy way to achieve this is doubling the DA for those days. To calculate this just add days to 31. Kids is 4 days and date night once a week is 4. That&rsquo;s 8 extra days. How can I track them? I could give myself them at the beginning so that I don&rsquo;t think about it.</li>
<li>Discussed the bonus day with Chris. He thinks it goes against the principles of FM. He&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;ll need to up my DA next week.</li>
<li>In the beginning I was real excited and tried to spend nothing, I realized it wasn&rsquo;t practical so my carry over isn&rsquo;t much if any. So, I&rsquo;ll up my DA next pay period but I think it&rsquo;s important to start low and adjust after a pay period.</li>
<li>Ending the day with $5.98</li>
</ul>
