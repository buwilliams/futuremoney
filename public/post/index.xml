      <description>If you haven’t read the original post, you’ll want to read 16-day personal finances experiment. This plan has worked so well that I’ve decided it deserves a #futuremoney hashtag. The main principal is easy to remember:
Do not spend future money.
The Results So Far I’m on day 9 of 16. In nine days, my view of money has radically changed but I’m not alone. As I’ve told my friends, they couldn’t wait for my experiment to end so they jumped in.</description>

What research has been done on complex systems? How can we make them better? This post is about how to fix our personal finances. Well, it’s an experiment to see if the research helps.
Like many of you, I’ve always spent what I make.</description>
